 * About this Software

blobify is a clojure application that identifies and analyzes connected components in
graylevel images and image stacks. The program works with image files in both tif and
lsm formats.

* Usage

To run blobify, you will need:

1) JDK 1.6+ from Sun/Oracle.
2) blobify-standalone.jar (contains clojure, clojure-contrib, and other jars)

Place blobify-standalone.jar in your classpath and execute

java -cp blobify-standalone.jar <image-file-roster>

where <image-file-roster> is a text file that lists each file to be processed on a
separate line, followed by the region of interest as a sequence of 6 integers,
according to the format:

<file-name> <row> <col> <layer> <width> <height> <thickness>

Each field should be separated by whitespace consisting of spaces,
tabs, or by commas.
